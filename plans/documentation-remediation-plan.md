# Documentation Remediation Plan

## Summary
Comprehensive documentation is essential for user onboarding, admin training, and developer productivity. The current implementation covers core features, but advanced analytics, review queue, and HealthKit integration are under-documented. This plan details the steps to achieve full parity with the unified platform spec and baselines.

## Steps
1. **User/Admin Documentation**
   - Document all new and advanced features (cohorts, analytics, review queue, custom check-ins, HealthKit flows).
   - Add usage guides, screenshots, and workflow diagrams.
2. **Developer Documentation**
   - Add technical docs for new APIs, models, and backend logic.
   - Document test setup, patterns, and best practices.
3. **Onboarding Guides**
   - Update onboarding docs for new flows and dev setup.
   - Add quickstart guides for new features.
4. **Documentation Review**
   - Regularly review and update docs as features evolve.
   - Solicit feedback from users and developers.

## Further Considerations
- Ensure all new features are documented before release.
- Update WORKLOG.md and STATE.md after each major step.

**This is the seventh most urgent remediation plan. Begin with user/admin docs for new features, then expand developer and onboarding guides.**
