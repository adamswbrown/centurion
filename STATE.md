## Data Model Notes
- Prisma Appointment model uses `startTime`, `endTime`, `fee`, `status`, optional `googleEventId`, `invoiceId`.
- Conflict checks enforced on create and update for overlapping sessions per member.
- Bootcamp attendee capacity enforced when adding attendees.
- Cohort model with `status` (ACTIVE/COMPLETED/ARCHIVED), optional `endDate`, multi-coach support.
- CohortMembership tracks member status (ACTIVE/PAUSED/INACTIVE) with `joinedAt`/`leftAt` timestamps.
- Invoice model with `paymentStatus` (UNPAID/PAID/OVERDUE/CANCELLED), `stripePaymentUrl`, `paidAt` timestamp.
- Invoices auto-generate from ATTENDED appointments, linking appointments via `invoiceId`.
- Entry model with `userId_date` unique constraint (one entry per user per day), JSON fields for `customResponses` and `dataSources`.
- QuestionnaireBundle model with `cohortId_weekNumber` unique constraint, `questions` JSON field for SurveyJS format.
- WeeklyQuestionnaireResponse model with `userId_bundleId` unique constraint, `responses` JSON, `status` enum (IN_PROGRESS/COMPLETED).
- CohortCheckInConfig model with `cohortId` unique, `prompts` JSON field for custom check-in prompts.

## Environment / Dependencies

- Environment variables: `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`, `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` (for production deployments).

## Open TODOs

- Run database migration for PairingCode model (`npx prisma migrate dev`).
- Add email system integration (Resend).
- Add cron job for weekly review queue reminder notifications.
- Consider adding print/PDF export for reports.
